/**
 * InventoryService.
 *
 * Session 6 — checkStock(): the synchronous, read-only pre-check called by
 * Order Service via OpenFeign before confirming an order.
 *
 * Session 7 — reserveStock()/releaseStock(): the actual stock mutations
 * driven by the Choreography Saga (InventorySagaHandler), reacting to
 * OrderPlaced / PaymentFailed Kafka events rather than being called
 * directly by another service.
 *
 * In-memory store (ConcurrentHashMap) — documented technical debt: no
 * persistence across restarts. See Session 8 Architecture Clinic
 * questions (docs/trainer/session-08-architecture-clinic-questions.md).
 *
 * Reservation tracking note: releaseStock(orderId) (Session 7's documented
 * signature — the Saga only has the orderId on the PaymentFailed event, not
 * the original productId/quantity) needs to know what THAT specific order
 * reserved. This repo tracks that with a small in-memory
 * reservationsByOrderId map alongside the stock map — itself another
 * documented technical debt item (in-memory, not persisted) consistent
 * with the rest of this class.
